In example, a base has until Feb 28 to submit complete trip records for January. Therefore, the January base aggregates will appear in March at the earliest. The TLC may elect to defer updates to the FHV Base Aggregate Report if a large number of bases have failed to submit trip records by the due date.\r\n\r\nNote: The TLC publishes base trip record data as submitted by the bases, and we cannot guarantee or confirm their accuracy or completeness. Therefore, this may not represent the total amount of trips dispatched by all TLC-licensed bases.

Each violation is identified using a unique Violation ID. These Laws are in place to provide requirements for the maintenance of residential dwelling units within New York City. \r\nViolations are issued by Housing Inspectors after a physical inspection is conducted (except for class I violations which are generally  administratively issued).  Violations are issued in four classes: Class A (non-hazardous), Class B (hazardous), Class C (immediately hazardous) and Class I (information orders).  For more information on violations, see https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/compliance-clear-violations.page  \r\nThe base data for this file is all violations open as of October 1, 2012.  Violation data is updated daily.  The daily update includes both new violations and updates to the status of previously issued violations. An open violation is a violation which is still active on the Department records. See the status table for determining how to filter for open violations versus closed violations, and within open violations for a more detailed current status. \r\nThe property owner may or may not have corrected the physical condition if the status is open. The violation status is closed when the violation is observed/verified as corrected by HPD or as certified by the landlord.   The processes for having violations dismissed are described at http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/compliance-clear-violations.page\r\nUsing other HPD datasets, such as the Building File or the Registration File, a user can link together violations issued for given buildings or for given owners.",
